                    <p>
                        The first step is done! <br> I am enrolled in a Web Development bootcamp with EDA and I have already created my first 
                        website. I am ready to leave my tourism career behind and think about my new long term goals.
                        I want to master several programming languages and work as a professional, top performing Web Developer within a team 
                        of a big company. 
                        After graduating from EDA the next step will be to get an entry level role in a company that will support me to grow 
                        further. I am not striving for a management role but would like to become a highly skilled team member who mentors 
                        work mates and is a sought-after contact person within the company for questions around everything web development. 
                        Further ( more personal ) goals are to increase my earnings and eventually be able to buy my own house, 
                        live a healthy life and just be happy and comfortable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While at EDA, I would like to see me develop my teamwork/interpersonal skills. So far, I only had jobs where everyone in 
                        the team was working on their own tasks. I would like to learn how to clearly communicate with team members, trust others, 
                        support and motivate others, as well as giving constructive feedback to others.
                        Furthermore, I would like to develop my problem-solving and analytical skills as well as to improve my emotional intelligence.                         
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My biggest strengths are my reliability, responsibility and commitment to tasks I have started. I am a person 
                        who is eager to learn new things and I bring a lot of self-discipline. I am honest, patient and I can stay calm 
                        in stressful situations. <br>
                        I am naturally shy and lacking a bit of confidence. This will probably be my biggest limitation as it often prevents 
                        me from asking questions. But once I am comfortable in a team, it is a lot better. I am also very self-critical.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am very aware that the EDA programme is not made for the faint-hearted and the workload during the bootcamp can be 
                        overwhelming. 
                        I am trying to stick as much as I can to the suggested time boxes in the learning material and soak in everything that 
                        is taught in the core material during foundations and trying to implement it into my learning days. I am setting myself 
                        goals at the beginning of every day and reflect on my achievements at night. I work with the toggle timer and have created 
                        a work environment for myself that is almost free of any disruptions which allows me to stay focused and concentrated. 
                        If I am stuck, I go and take a short break, and then I try it again. 
                        I am also taking some time for self-care to recharge my energy. I exercise almost daily, eat a balanced diet, chat to friends 
                        and family and try to get 8 hours of sleep every night. <br>
                        I am confident that if I am able to manage to be productive during foundations and get everything done in time, I am set up 
                        very well for bootcamp. I am quite a self-disciplined person and can push myself through tough times. I am not someone 
                        who gives up easily. I would rather work extra hours to get something done than to fail to deliver results.                         
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Seeking help is certainly something for me that needs improvement. I can sometimes be too proud to ask someone for help. 
                        I often push myself to figure things out on my own ( or with the help of Google ). 
                        However, as soon as I notice that I am frequently behind the suggested time boxes or the people in my cohort are ahead of me, 
                        I will certainly ask for help. If I am stuck with something, have exhausted all my options and can’t find anything helpful 
                        on Google, I will ask my cohort or facilitator for help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the facilitator team I expect guidance and feedback. Guidance through difficult tasks by giving some advice or information 
                        that helps me to solve a problem by myself, and speeds up the process. But also constructive feedback to help me improve for 
                        the next challenge or for the future in general.
