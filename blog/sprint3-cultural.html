            <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
                <p class="introduction-text">
                    Being super smart and having a high IQ doesn't necessarily mean that you will get that job. But if you are an emotionally 
                    intelligent person ( and can prove that in your job interview ), you are a big step closer to it. 
                    <br> The good news is: You can learn to be an emotional intelligent person. Lucky you! 
                    <br> But let's actually have a closer look at what Emotional Intelligence means.
                </p>

                <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Emotional intelligence is being aware of your actions and feelings, as well as how they affect those around you, 
                        and the ability to manage your own emotions. It also involves being aware of how others are feeling and responding. 
                        <br> Here are a few examples of signs that emotionally intelligent people show:
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>understand their actions and behaviours</li>
                            <li>great listeners</li>
                            <li>excellent problem solver</li>
                            <li>can get along with people in different situations</li>
                            <li>able to shake off a bad moment and move on</li>
                            <li>accept contstructive criticism</li>
                            <li>not afraid of being vulnerable</li>
                            <li>not afraid to admit mistakes and apologise</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>
                        For some people emotional intelligence comes just naturally, others need to learn it.
                    </p>
                    <p>The American psychologist Daniel Goleman has worked out five key elements that are critical to emotional intelligence:
                    </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><span class="bold">Self-Awareness:</span> Being fully aware of how you feel and understanding the effect your 
                                feelings and your actions can have on people around you.</li> 
                            <li><span class="bold">Self-Regulation:</span> Controling, regulating and expressing your emotions appropriately.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Social Skills:</span> Interacting and communicationg well with others.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Empathy:</span> Being able to understand how others are feeling.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Motivation:</span> Being action-oriented and working towards your own goals as well as 
                                motivating others.</li>
                        </ol>

                <h3>How is Emotional Intelligence different to IQ?</h3>
                    <p>
                        First of all it is different by how it is measured. The intelligence quotient is a score derived from standardized tests 
                        designed to measure intelligence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An IQ relates directly to a persons intellectual and cognitive abilities and measures how well someone can use information 
                        and logic to answer questions or make predictions. The results are then compared to average scores of people in the same 
                        age group.
                    </p>
                    <p>People with higher IQs can think more abstractly. In the workplace, people with high IQ are more successful with 
                        challenging tasks and the ability to analyze.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Emotional Intelligence is very different. Those with high emotional intelligence are able to manage their emotions 
                        and use their emotions to facilitate their thinking and to understand the emotions of others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to the workplace, emotional intelligence seems to be more beneficial for one's career. 
                        Emotional intelligent people are usually better team players and leaders, are service oriented and show initiative.

                <h3>Why is Emotional Intelligence so important?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The world is constantly changing. It is a complex and uncertain place. Emotional intelligence can help us in our 
                        personal and in our work lives. 
                        <h4 class="subtitle">Personal life:</h4>
                            <p>
                                It can assist us to look after our mental and physical health and well-being, to manage relationships 
                                effectively and to solve conflicts.
                            </p>
                            <p>If we can't manage our emotions, we will most likely not be able to manage stress either. 
                                This can ultimately lead to physical health problems like high blood pressure, suppressed immune system, 
                                risk of heart attacks, etc.
                                It can also have an impact on our mental health, leading to anxiety and depression, or being unable to form 
                                strong relationships and feeling lonely and isolated.
                                If we learn to understand and control our emotions, we are better to express our feelings and have empathy 
                                with others which leads to more effective communication and forms stronger relationships. 
                            </p>
                        <h4 class="subtitle">Workplace:</h4>
                            <p>
                                Today's workplaces are a melting pot of different personalities, skills, strengths and emotions. 
                                Employers want to make sure they choose candidates who will mesh well with their existing team and navigate 
                                the workplace effectively.
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                                EQ is particularly important in leadership roles and vital for success. If leaders lack emotional intelligence, 
                                it could result in lower employee engagement and higher turnover rate as a consequence.
                            </p>
                            <p class="bold">Even the smartest person needs good people skills to succeed these days. High intelligence is no 
                                longer guarantee for success in life.
